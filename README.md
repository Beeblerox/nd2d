# ND2D - A Flash Molehill (Stage3D) GPU accelerated 2D engine.

ND2D is a 2D sprite engine using the new GPU hardware features of flash currently available in a beta build. To run this engine you must download and install the latest flash player:

[Flash Player 11 Beta & playerglobal.swc](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer11.html)

You have to compile ND2D with the FP11 beta playerglobal.swc to get it to work.

ND2D was built to make an ease use of hardware accelerated 2D content in the Flashplayer. The aim is to keep things simple and reintroduce familiar concepts. ND2D has a displaylist and quite the same methods to modify sprites as you are used to.

If you want to contribute, make bugfixes or extend the engine, feel free to fork it or email me: lars[at]nulldesign.de

# Features:

- Flash-displaylist-like hierarchy for 2D elements
- 2D sprites with tinting, blendmodes, pivot points
- Support for spritesheets and texture atlases
- Scenes
- 2D camera
- SpriteCloud / Batch for massive sprite rendering
- Powerful particlesystem that runs entirely on the GPU
- Full mouseevent support for 2D sprites
- Utils (Color mixing, random number generation, â€¦)
- Fast bitmap fonts
- Distortable 2D grid for wave / ripple effects
- Texturerenderer for post process effects
- Extendable material system that makes it easy to write own effects and shaders with PixelBender3D or AGAL

- TextureAtlas / TexturePacker: http://blog.kaourantin.net/?p=110
- ParticleSystem2D: add support for bursts!
- Lines?

Feature request: could you make an option to use nearest neighbor instead of linear filtering when you zoom in? Pixel art looks much better if you have big pixels instead of a blurry image.
Also, are you planning to make tilemaps?

- ATF support
- ParticleSystem2D: add support for bursts!
- Multitouch events
+ texture smoothing mipmap, nearest, linear, etc. customize per object or per ND2D instance?
- premultiplied / non premultiplied alpha check for textures!
+ Depricate bitmapData as constructor argument. Only Texture2D allowed! Static creation methods?
- updateFromPreset method for particlesystem to update the buffer on the fly?!
- blurmaterial
- mask size restricted to 2^ bug? outer coordinates "go wild"? border / clamp
- solid / gradient quad as new object
+ UV coordinates tiles multiplier
- ZoÃ«: A SWF animation exporter for the EaselJS library. ? more TextureAtlas tools?
- pixel perfect collisions -> save bitmapdata alpha channel? only 1-bit
- premultiplied / non premultiplied alpha - bug in particlesystem? dynamic per texturetype
+ color uint instead of number
- multiple worlds test
+ rotationXYZ, z depth's?
- camera zoom example for independent resolutions
- Sprite2DCloud - addChildAt - invalidation not THAT agressive if possible?
- http://nulldesign.de/nd2d/forum/topic.php?id=53 crop bug? smoothing?
- premultiplied alpha bug for sprite2dcloud

What I don't like about the spritesheets is:
- it's a pain to declare animations from a (cocos2D) spritesheet - it needs a simpler way like just sheet.playAnimation("foo*") and it would automatically build the animation with all assets named "foo001.png", "foo002.png", etc.
- and it seems inefficient to have to clone the spritesheet object.
About Sprite2DBatch: only addChildAt/removeChildAt are implemented and I'm not sure why addChild/removeChild aren't - maybe there's a hidden reason? Also invalidation in the *At methods seem a bit aggressive.
